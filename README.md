**Inspired by the Universal Catholic Church's Rome Call for AI Ethics**


**Algorethics AI Library** is a Python library crafted to assist AI developers in aligning their projects with ethical principles inspired by faith. This initiative focuses on creating AI systems that honor human dignity, promote inclusion, ensure transparency, and uphold responsibility.

As Scripture guides us:

- **Respecting Human Dignity:** "So God created mankind in his own image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them." (Genesis 1:27)

- **Promoting Inclusion:** "The body is a unit, though it is made up of many parts; and though all its parts are many, they form one body. So it is with Christ." (1 Corinthians 12:12)

- **Ensuring Transparency:** "For nothing is hidden that will not become evident, nor anything secret that will not be known and come to light." (Luke 8:17)

- **Upholding Responsibility:** "Everyone to whom much was given, of him much will be required; and from him to whom they entrusted much, they will demand the more." (Luke 12:48)


## Key Features

- **Privacy Policies**: Ensure the protection of sensitive information.
- **Transparency Policies**: Guarantee that AI models are explainable and understandable.
- **Inclusion Policies**: Promote inclusivity and prevent discrimination.
- **Responsibility Policies**: Establish accountability for AI actions and decisions.
- **Impartiality Policies**: Prevent bias in AI systems to safeguard fairness.
- **Reliability Policies**: Ensure high reliability and uptime for AI systems.

## Installation

To install Algorethics, use pip:

```bash
pip install algorethics
```

## Usage

Here's an example of how to use the Algorethics AI Library in your project:

### Step 1: Define Ethical Policies

Define functions that represent your ethical policies. These functions should return a boolean indicating whether the policy is satisfied.

```python
def privacy_policy_example(data):
    """Ensure that sensitive information is not included in the data."""
    return not any(key in data for key in ["private", "confidential", "secret"])

def transparency_policy_example(model):
    """Ensure that the AI model is explainable."""
    return hasattr(model, 'explainability')

def inclusion_policy_example(data):
    """Ensure that no individual is excluded based on discriminatory attributes."""
    return all(item.get("status") != "excluded" for item in data)

def responsibility_policy_example(action):
    """Ensure that there is accountability for actions taken by the AI."""
    return action.get("responsible_party") is not None

def impartiality_policy_example(data):
    """Ensure that the AI system does not create or follow biases."""
    return all(item.get("bias") == 0 for item in data)

def reliability_policy_example(system):
    """Ensure that the AI system maintains high reliability."""
    return system.get("uptime", 0) > 99.9
```

### Step 2: Initialize Algorethics and Add Policies

Create an instance of the `Algorethics` class and add the defined policies.

```python
from algorethics import Algorethics

# Initialize the Algorethics class
ai_lib = Algorethics()

# Add policies to the library
ai_lib.add_privacy_policy(privacy_policy_example)
ai_lib.add_transparency_policy(transparency_policy_example)
ai_lib.add_inclusion_policy(inclusion_policy_example)
ai_lib.add_responsibility_policy(responsibility_policy_example)
ai_lib.add_impartiality_policy(impartiality_policy_example)
ai_lib.add_reliability_policy(reliability_policy_example)
```

### Step 3: Validate AI Project

Use the `validate` method to check if your AI project adheres to the defined ethical policies.

```python
# Example data, model, action, and system for validation
data = [{"status": "included", "bias": 0}]
model = {"explainability": True}
action = {"responsible_party": "team_lead"}
system = {"uptime": 99.95}

# Validate the AI project
if ai_lib.validate(data, model, action, system):
    print("AI project is ethically compliant")
else:
    print("AI project is not ethically compliant")
```

### Full Example

Combining all steps into a complete example:

```python
from algorethics import Algorethics

# Define ethical policies
def privacy_policy_example(data):
    return not any(key in data for key in ["private", "confidential", "secret"])

def transparency_policy_example(model):
    return hasattr(model, 'explainability')

def inclusion_policy_example(data):
    return all(item.get("status") != "excluded" for item in data)

def responsibility_policy_example(action):
    return action.get("responsible_party") is not None

def impartiality_policy_example(data):
    return all(item.get("bias") == 0 for item in data)

def reliability_policy_example(system):
    return system.get("uptime", 0) > 99.9

# Initialize Algorethics
ai_lib = Algorethics()

# Add policies
ai_lib.add_privacy_policy(privacy_policy_example)
ai_lib.add_transparency_policy(transparency_policy_example)
ai_lib.add_inclusion_policy(inclusion_policy_example)
ai_lib.add_responsibility_policy(responsibility_policy_example)
ai_lib.add_impartiality_policy(impartiality_policy_example)
ai_lib.add_reliability_policy(reliability_policy_example)

# Example data, model, action, and system
data = [{"status": "included", "bias": 0}]
model = {"explainability": True}
action = {"responsible_party": "team_lead"}
system = {"uptime": 99.95}

# Validate AI project
if ai_lib.validate(data, model, action, system):
    print("AI project is ethically compliant")
else:
    print("AI project is not ethically compliant")
```
